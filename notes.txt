Global and Block scope variables
Hoisting - All variables go at the top and become undefined (initially) , which lead to the invention of Global scope variable = var

If a same variable is inside the function block , the variable again becomes undefined and the value within the function gets assigned to the variable (ASSUME IT LIKE GENETIC PROPERTIES PASSED ON FROM PARENTS TO CHILDREN , NEVER THE REVERSE)
